The progress of the application has been hindered by a number of disputes within the Claim Group including, inter alia, disputes about which members of the Claim Group should represent it as the applicant in this proceeding and about the area that should be the subject of the claim.

Although I accepted that the Lawsons had lost the confidence of some important members of the Claim Group I was not satisfied that the evidence was sufficient to show that the Claim Group, by appropriate decision-making processes, had revoked their authority to represent it or had authorised other members of the Claim Group to replace them.

In essence, Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson believe that the area subject to the claim should be split between two claims, those of the people they regard as 'pure' Barkandji people and those of the other members of the Claim Group.

By this notice of motion, an amended version of which was filed in Court on 13 December 2005, members of the Claim Group seek an order under s 66B of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ('the NTA') replacing the current applicant on grounds that the current applicant is no longer authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it.

In effect the motion seeks: (a) to remove Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson from the applicant group as well as a third member, Mrs Patricia Johnson; and (b) to add two new members, Mr Murray Butcher and Mr Derek Hardman.

Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson oppose the application to remove them; Mrs Johnson has not appeared or made any submissions however it is alleged that, because of her ill health, she no longer wishes to be part of the group that comprises the applicant or to be involved in the management of the proceeding.

10 In opposing the application for leave for Mr Dengate to appear, Ms Phillips, who appeared for New South Wales Native Title Services ('NTS'), pointed out that the application for leave (which was signed by Mr Dengate) sought to have him represent Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson not only in respect of the present motion but also in the substantive proceedings.

In particular, she referred to correspondence dated 7 October 2005 from NTS to both Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson advising them that the 1 October meeting had resolved to invite them to resign from the applicant group and had authorised other members of the Claim Group to replace them.

In addition to numerous phone calls with members of the Claim Group, Ms Holt deposed that she had several telephone conversations with Mr Lawson, Mr Johnson and Ms Shelia Kirby, Mr Johnson's wife.

Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson did not attend the meeting, although the evidence discloses that they were invited and were aware the meeting was to take place and neither Mr Lawson nor Mr Johnson sought to deny this.

Further, the meeting resolved to invite those members of the applicant group who disagree with a united claim to resign and authorised Murray Butcher and Derek Hardman to replace them as members of the applicant group.

The meeting then authorised the so-termed 'new applicant', in which Mr Butcher and Mr Hardman replaced Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson, to make the native title claim and to deal with matters arising in relation to it.

'A person or persons authorised by all the persons (the native title claim group ) who, according to their traditional laws and customs, hold the common or group rights and interests comprising the particular native title claimed, provided the person or persons are also included in the native title claim group. ' 27 Subsection 61(2) of the NTA provides that the persons authorised to make the claimant application by the native title claim group are jointly the 'applicant' and none of the other members of the native title claim group is the 'applicant'.

(1) One or more members of the native title claim group (the claim group ) in relation to a claimant application, or of the compensation claim group (also the claim group ) in relation to a compensation application, may apply to the Federal Court for an order that the member, or the members jointly, replace the current applicant for the application on the grounds that: For the purposes of this Act, all the persons in a native title claim group or compensation claim group authorise a person or persons to make a native title determination application or a compensation application, and to deal with matters arising in relation to it, if: (a) where there is a process of decision-making that, under the traditional laws and customs of the persons in the native title claim group or compensation claim group, must be complied with in relation to authorising things of that kind--the persons in the native title claim group or compensation claim group authorise the person or persons to make the application and to deal with the matters in accordance with that process; or (b) where there is no such process--the persons in the native title claim group or compensation claim group authorise the other person or persons to make the application and to deal with the matters in accordance with a process of decision-making agreed to and adopted, by the persons in the native title claim group or compensation claim group, in relation to authorising the making of the application and dealing with the matters, or in relation to doing things of that kind. ' As such, the issues in the present context revolve around whether the Claim Group no longer authorises Messrs Lawson and Johnson to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it and whether those making the application under s 66B of the NTA are so authorised by the Claim Group in their stead.

33 For these reasons, I am satisfied that the orders sought, insofar as they relate to the removal of Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson from the applicant group and the inclusion of Mr Murray Butcher and Mr Derek Hardman, should be made.
