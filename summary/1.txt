When the UN climate convention was signed back in 1992, the world was divided into developed and developing countries.

The richer countries now want the new Paris deal to reflect how the world has changed.

"Developed countries and now many developing countries acknowledge that the world has changed," said Michael Jacobs, a climate adviser to British Prime Minister at the time of the Copenhagen talks in 2009, Gordon Brown.

"There are many different kinds of countries, and they want developing countries to act as well as developed.

"We cannot accept starvation as a price for the success of this agreement," said Gurdial Singh Nijar of Malaysia, who was speaking for the Like Minded Group of countries in these talks that includes China, India and Saudi Arabia.

There are concerns over finance as well, as the richer countries want to expand the base of donor countries if there is to be an increase in the promised $100bn from 2020 to help the poorer countries cope with climate change and ease their transition to low-carbon electricity.

"Our negotiators must contribute to hours of talks, representing the poorest nations, as other countries tap in and out around them, as well as fitting in all the other meetings at the start and end of the day," said a source close to the group.
