I grew up at a time when we were still celebrating our social solidarity and common humanity premised on the doctrine that every human being has the right to justice, equality, security and dignity.

Sadly, our resolve to be a just, humane society has crumbled under the weight of the fault lines of bigotry, bias, violence and dehumanisation.

So inured to injustice have we become that we missed the irony in our erudite vice president's recent plea to ensure the right to life, irrespective of religion.

Such an appeal would be platitudinous in a truly egalitarian society, but it's a timely exhortation in our context.

There are myriad combat zones revolving around xenophobia (Bangladeshis), racism (ask our brothers in the Northeast), gender discrimination, casteism, affirmative action, regionalism all of which have diminished our claims to being a humane society.

But what we have are cynical politicians who have exacerbated social tensions.

Given his former political affiliations, even the president's iterated sermons on tolerance were viewed with suspicion.
