Surely the censor board understands that the A rating entitles a film to enjoy some colorful cussing.

Or did the censor board get all hot and bothered because this is a FEMALE buddy film.

Because hey that's what works for these characters except it doesn't, because the censor board has gone snip, snip, snip all over the dialogue.

And because they are in that kind of mood, they don't just stop with censoring the cussing but also snip out 'adivasi', 'Indian figure', 'lunch' If the filmmakers need therapy now, the government must pay for it.

But the censor board has insisting on blurring all the images of various goddesses in the film.
