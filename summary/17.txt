In this government PM Narendra Modi was accused of bunking Parliament, which is why his interventions last week show that he certainly isn't Maun Modi when he chooses not to be.

The tears of Kumari Selja who said she was denied entry into a temple because of her caste showed that even though the House was debating the Constitution, constitutional values in the rest of the country are still debatable.

The debate on the Constitution and on intolerance had enough moments of fine cut and thrust to suggest that MPs can discover their parliamentary spirit when they want, even though the opposition is determined to deny any goods and services to the government.
