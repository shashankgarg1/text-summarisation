Cities like NCR, Mumbai, Bengaluru see other factors that drive further demand; high immigrant population with several 100,000s moving in and out of these cities every year creates churn and opportunity; also these cities see demand from neighboring states e.g.

What is driving this paradoxical situation is a market that is going through change; a market that is going through the pain of transitioning from the high-growth expectations of the past to a mature one that will see saner returns.

they launch one project, and use the capital from initial sale to start a second project, then use the proceeds from the second project to start a third and then a fourth and sometimes even a fifth.

This strategy worked during high-growth periods, but in a slow market, where projects don't sell as quickly, when one project is unable to sell, it puts the death-knell on all 4-5 projects.

Such behavior/delays, not only seriously impact returns (IRRs), but dampens overall investment sentiment thus putting the market in a downward-spiral of prices not rising, unsold inventory, incomplete projects, leading to further depressed prices/returns.

Consequently, the industry is now shifting from a "pre-launch" to a build and sell model like developed markets, again signs of a maturing industry.

The real estate market is considered as one of the drivers of growth for developing economies.

Whether the inventory remains unsold or is in the hands of speculative real estate investors, there is a desperate search for end-customers and real users who remain elusive.

It is interesting to note that from historically being a seller's market, real estate in India is now a buyers market.

As buyers, dictate terms price discovery in the non-transparent real estate market becomes the main problem.
