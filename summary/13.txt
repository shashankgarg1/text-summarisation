DMK parliamentarian Kanimozhi appealed to all political parties in Tamil Nadu to set aside differences in the face of a calamity.

Water borne diseases and vector borne diseases such as dengue have to be kept at bay.

The frequency with which natural disasters strike India suggests that disaster management response protocols at the Centre need a lot more attention than they currently get.
