Nepal's top political leadership has agreed to amend Nepal's controversial, new constitution "within three months" to address the demands of the agitating Madhesi population in southern Nepal, but an important meeting on Saturday among the concerned parties failed to end the deadlock.

While Kathmandu has accused New Delhi of sanctioning and continuing the blockade, which began soon after the promulgation of the constitution in late September, the Union government has cited the violent unrest in Nepal's southern plains by those aggrieved at the allegedly exclusionist constitution.

Despite the renewed warmth in the relationship, which began with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's August 2014 visit and culminated in the aftermath of the April 2015 earthquake, Delhi's apprehensions about Nepal resurfaced with the promulgation of the constitution, seen widely as discriminatory against the Madhesis, Tharus and Janajatis.
