Given the views he holds, in today's parlance, he is certainly far removed from being classified as a liberal; in fact some of the conspiracy theory chain e-mails that he forwards to me so generously are the reason why my hair is turning gradually white.

I will not embarrass him by recounting the many small ways in which he has helped others, cutting across many of the divides of class, caste and religion that have become fault lines today.

Labels like liberal or conservative capture but a small aspect of the complexity of a person, and even here, they may not necessarily give a clue to how people behave in their everyday lives.

Most of the issues that have been getting people riled up have little to do with their own everyday lives.

And earlier such differences surfaced occasionally but rarely dominated personal relationships- we responded to other people as people and not as extensions of their political views, something that is changing quite perceptibly in the last few years.

We are not important enough to be known by our views, but we are singular in the way we respond to the world, our friends and near and dear ones.

It is instructive to look at the new kind of ways in which people describe themselves on Twitter, also the site for much of the anger and hate.

Holding strong views on politics is an important part of the democratic process.
