His online research led to a retailer of 3D-printed jewellery, and Tamta eventually got her a distinctive, 3D-printed ring with an LOTR quote inscribed around the band in calligraphy letters.

Tamta's singular gift was crafted by the Coimbatore-based startup AuGrav, a customised online gold jewellery brand that marries the wonders of 3D-printing technology to India's gold craze.

And bespoke 3D-printed jewellery could be just the thing for younger, affluent Indians who want some pieces of modern jewellery to express their identity, not just their heritage.

AuGrav, whose Au stands for gold and Grav "to make", customises pieces of jewellery based on the buyer's personality or design.

"We believe there is an individual piece of jewellery for every one of the seven billion people on this planet," declares AuGrav's founder, Vivek Krishna.

Krishna bootstrapped AuGrav and decided to harness the power of 3D-printing technology to personalise jewellery.

In a country that has long associated gold jewellery with status and wealth rather than exclusivity and design, AuGrav is a hit with customers.
