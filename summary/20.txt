The mediaeval Delhi Sultan Muhammad-bin-Tughluq had a bright idea one day in the year 1327.

Ergo, he decreed, the capital of the Tughluq sultanate would be shifted from Delhi in the north to Daulatabad in central India.

Some 688 years later, in response to a court's comment that Delhi has become a gas-chamber in terms of atmospheric pollution, the chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has decided that, from January 1, 2016, private vehicles with licence-plates ending with odd and even numbers should ply on alternate days.

An estimated 1,500 new private vehicles are registered every day in Delhi.

One quixotic response to this decree to introduce the odd-even-number formula could be a scenario where car-owners buy a second vehicle and register it with an odd license-number if the first car has an even number, and vice versa.

After the quadrupling, each Delhi MLA could get more than the President of India or the PM and can hence afford a second car whose licence-plate could be registered as ending in an odd number if the first car has has a licence-plate ending in an even number, or vice versa.
