Many of the IITs that were set up in 2008 have failed to impress IIT Mandi hasn't even fully shifted to its main campus.

Such an argument severely misjudges the enormous role IITs have played in building quality education in the country.

In fact the first five IITs established their global credentials as early as the 70s and 80s when they accounted for close to 10% of the total engineering enrolments in India.

Numbers in fact also show that the 16 IITs are now able to enrol only 10,000 plus students annually, which is only a miniscule share of the estimated 1,00,000 high quality engineers needed in the country each year.

Six new IITs would mobilise new talent from far flung, untapped regions and restore the premier role that IITs have historically played in expanding quality education in engineering.
