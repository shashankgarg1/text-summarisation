So to tackle toxic air quality, AAP has decided to restrict private vehicles with odd and even numbered registration plates on alternate days.

There are about 90 lakh registered vehicles in Delhi with about 1,500 new ones being added every day and lakhs more pouring in from neighbouring areas.

Rope in all available public transport vehicles from neighbouring states, maximise the capacity of sparsely used ones like school buses, increase the frequency of both metro and suburban trains.
