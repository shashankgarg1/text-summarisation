First, GST rates have to be moderate and reasonable so that an unfair burden is not imposed on ordinary consumers.

It would otherwise defeat the very purpose of having a consolidated GST which is to ensure that the ultimate amount levied is not onerous or oppressive for the final consumer.

Given all that has been said in defence of GST by the ruling establishment, a fixed rate seems like a fairly reasonable idea.

Second, the levy of an 'additional tax' of up to 1% by manufacturing states over and above the GST rate not only leads to market distortion but it's also an extra burden and an embargo on movement of goods from one state to the other.

To understand why the existing GST Council is problematic when it comes to settling disputes, we may take recourse to a hypothetical illustration where a state such as Maharashtra may have an objection to the amount of tax revenue being returned.

Exempting goods/commodities such as alcohol, electricity, petroleum products and tobacco from the purview of GST runs counterproductive to the very idea of a consolidated goods and services tax being advanced.

The voting pattern of the GST Council giving a disproportionately high presence to central government vis-a-vis states goes against the principle of cooperative federalism advocated by the government so often.
