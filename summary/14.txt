The Indian hockey team won the bronze in the World Hockey League last evening, beating the Netherlands, a team ranked 2nd in the world (we are at No.

This is the first time since the Champions Trophy in 1982, where India finished 3rd, has our hockey team finished among the medals in a genuinely world-class event.

Our team can now be counted among the fittest in the world.

More importantly, when you see them play, the boys demonstrate a self-confidence and belief in their abilities, when they take on the top 3 teams in the world, that one has not seen since the days of Mohd Shahid, Zafar Iqbal, Mervyn Fernandez, Sommaya and Pargat Singh.

It is something that often our very good teams in the past lacked, especially when playing top ranked teams.

I have always said that when we are leading, our hockey team ensures we have the longest one minute in the game.

In fact, I have often joked that the team should be told there are three more minutes for the game to end when there is one, that way they would end the game without the jitters affecting them May sound like a cry baby, but whether one likes it or not, whenever push-comes-to-shove, the umpiring decisions go against our team.

Now that India is putting so much money into world hockey, when so much sponsorship is coming from India, when India is hosting some of the biggest tournaments, when so much money is being made by players all over the world courtesy the Hockey India league, why shouldn't we demand from FIH that at least be fair to our teams? The most credible and effective way for the team to silence all umpires and all others, of course, would be to perform consistently at the level they have been performing.
