Schools in Beijing are to close and outdoor construction to stop after the Chinese capital issued its first "red alert" over smog levels.

Current pollution levels in Beijing are actually lower than last week's, but the red alert has been placed because of levels expected over the coming days.

Activists said the level hit 1,400 micrograms per cubic metre in the north-east city of Shenyang last month, saying it was the worst seen in China.
