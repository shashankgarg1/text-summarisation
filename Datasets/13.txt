If there is a silver lining in the tragedy that has engulfed Chennai, it is the quiet heroism of many of its residents. Stories abound of people who have gone out of their way to help others. Doctors have offered free services, public transport drivers have taken considerable risks and many others have pitched in with hot meals and places to stay. The fortitude of Chennaites needs acknowledgement. When monsoons break century-old records, perhaps the human spirit is the biggest bulwark.
DMK parliamentarian Kanimozhi appealed to all political parties in Tamil Nadu to set aside differences in the face of a calamity. Her appeal should be heeded. This is not the time to engage in a blame game. Thousands of people are still cut off from basic services. Discharge of water from lakes around the city continues to ravage. A disaster of this magnitude needs all hands on board. Chennai’s challenges will not end soon. As the water recedes, public health issues will surface. Water borne diseases and vector borne diseases such as dengue have to be kept at bay. Meeting these challenges requires a united effort and Tamil Nadu can ill afford political wrangling at this moment.
The Centre too needs to pitch in. There can always be a gap between what a state affected by a calamity wants and the Centre’s response. But there should be no bureaucratic hold-ups in sending over resources. The frequency with which natural disasters strike India suggests that disaster management response protocols at the Centre need a lot more attention than they currently get. If the legislature and executive need inspiration to get their act together, they can do no better than emulate the people of Chennai. The city’s everyman should be their touchstone.
