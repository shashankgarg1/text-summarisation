Akhilesh Yadav, UP’s chief minister, proved that filial affection knows no bounds. It is the defining feature of Indian culture. One that has kept the television soap opera industry, in all languages, in the black regardless of the economy’s state. As a pre-condition to a Lok Sabha electoral alliance, Akhilesh has proposed his father, Mulayam Singh Yadav, be the prime ministerial candidate. The ‘Super CM’ will be sent off to become PM. Perhaps Akhilesh can then go on to become a real CM and Harvard Business School can use this development as a case study for a successful two-way transition in a family business.
Filial reverence has a long history in India. A Chola king built a new structure a wee bit smaller than a temple erected by his father and, thereby, proved a point his father could not. Competition is not precluded in any aspect of Indian culture; only in socialism. Samajwadi Party may claim to be socialist, but Akhilesh has proved the party’s soul is entirely Indian. Where else would a sitting chief minister respectfully refer to his most formidable political rival as ‘aunt’?
Any conversation on Indian culture has to encompass cricket. Stuart Binny should draw inspiration from Akhilesh. Perhaps he should retire from international cricket with a caveat: Roger Binny should be reinstated as a national selector. This sacrifice would be in sync with Indian values and a good antidote to imported ideas such as conflict of interest. If it is all in the family, accountability can be enforced. Ask Akhilesh. He is berated by his father, but remains unfazed. What else are fathers for? With so much going for Indian culture, what remains a puzzle is the relative backwardness of India. Could there actually be a problem somewhere?
