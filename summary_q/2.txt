This has further improved the predictability of the fiscal burden.
The commission assumes a nominal growth of 11.5 per cent with an inflation rate of 4 per cent in 2016-17.
We have seen a worse period of high and stubborn inflation and its inertia.
Further, assuming no other exogenous shocks take place, the dearness allowances over the next 10 years may be much lower than the 125 per cent increase witnessed over the past decade.
Another important issue that needs clarity is the commission’s claim of a smaller increase in the PAP/ GDP ratio (at 0.63 per cent) as compared to the previous commission (at 0.77 per cent).
Lastly, an important suggestion in the report, which was also stressed by the chairman at the press meet, is to undertake the pay revisions at shorter intervals instead of every 10 years.
This would avoid shocks and ensure better macro-fiscal balance.
