Last year, total expenditure at the state level (17.1 per cent of the GDP) was much higher than the Centre’s expenditure (13.3 per cent), and state capital expenditure (capex) was almost double the Centre’s.
Against this backdrop, what are state bond yields telling us?
This could either reflect a credit spread — showing higher credit risk because there’s no explicit sovereign guarantee for these bonds — or a liquidity premium, given that the market for state bonds is much less liquid than that for G-Secs.
But it’s hard to imagine that when both are added up, debt levels are exactly identical across states, so as to warrant such little price differentiation.
States will not be rewarded by markets for prudence, nor punished for profligacy.
And market signals are important because the 14th Finance Commission doesn’t provide incentives for states to reduce deficits below 3 per cent of the GDP.
