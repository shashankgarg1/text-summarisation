It had featured some of the most outstanding films and filmmakers from Asia, Africa and Latin America.
But in recent years, the shift has been evident — one finds European-Hollywood films and “masters” occupying centrestage.
This is in tune with trends in the international film festival circuit — now run by individual programmers, curators, foundations and global production and marketing agencies.
They were not solely determined by commercial tastes, and had some semblance of a national representation.
Since the 1990s, with the retreat of the state from cultural patronage, private agencies, museums, programmers and curators, apart from production houses and marketing agencies, have captured the international film festival circuit.
With almost half a century of experience, it’s time Iffi took the initiative in packaging, curating and marketing quality Indian films (not Bollywood).
The other striking thing about Iffi this year was the cold response to the FTII strike.
There were protests by students and filmmakers like Saeed Mirza, R.V. Ramani, Dhritiman Chatterjee, etc.
Not even the open forums witnessed a token protest.
On the one hand is the panic of a Goliath-like Iffi establishment vis-a-vis the Davids of the FTII, showing how effective a popular struggle is.
So the malaise is eating into our body cinematic from all sides.
