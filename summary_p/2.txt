This has further improved the predictability of the fiscal burden.
The share of capital expenditure is pegged at 1.1 per cent of GDP for both FY16 and FY17.
Further, an National Institute of Public Finance and Policy analysis (Working Paper No 2015-148) submitted to the 14th Finance Commission suggested that even with an assumption of a modest pay hike of 15 per cent (very close to the actual recommendations without One rank one pension), there is a need to compromise on either the fiscal deficit target or the share of capital expenditure (or perhaps both).
We have seen a worse period of high and stubborn inflation and its inertia.
Another important issue that needs clarity is the commission’s claim of a smaller increase in the PAP/ GDP ratio (at 0.63 per cent) as compared to the previous commission (at 0.77 per cent).
This would avoid shocks and ensure better macro-fiscal balance.
