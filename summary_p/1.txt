Considering the original claim to authorship and conception of this law rests with us, that would be a disingenuous proposition.
As its exponent, Congress advocates the creation of a meaningful, effective and implementable architecture of GST.
For this, there must be a constitutional cap on the GST rate to be charged – this should preferably be 18%.
Second, the levy of an ‘additional tax’ of up to 1% by manufacturing states over and above the GST rate not only leads to market distortion but it’s also an extra burden and an embargo on movement of goods from one state to the other.
To understand why the existing GST Council is problematic when it comes to settling disputes, we may take recourse to a hypothetical illustration where a state such as Maharashtra may have an objection to the amount of tax revenue being returned.
Thus there must be a quasi-judicial body, at arm’s length, comprised of independent individuals who would be qualified to decide upon such disputes.
Exempting goods/commodities such as alcohol, electricity, petroleum products and tobacco from the purview of GST runs counterproductive to the very idea of a consolidated goods and services tax being advanced.
We would be remiss in our duty as the principle party in opposition if we did not evaluate the impacts of a law that many perceive to be of supreme importance in encouraging economic growth.
