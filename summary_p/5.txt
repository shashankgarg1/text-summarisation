Prima facie, therefore, the statement lived up to what Mervyn King, a former Bank of England governor, famously listed as an essential feature of good monetary policy: Boring.
Never mind that a careful reading of the fine print of the statement shows the RBI has reservations on both its growth and inflation projections.
Not quite.
Consider this.
On January 15, the date of the first repo rate cut, the yield on the benchmark 10-year government securities fell from 7.77% to 7.69%.
On December 1, after a 125 basis points cut in the repo rate, the yield on 10-year G-Secs stood at 7.75%.
It is to try and iron out glitches in the transmission mechanism.
Combining Action
If the RBI wants to influence longerterm rates, it must combine repo rate action with aggressive OMO across maturities.
However, for a variety of reasons, it is unable to do so at present.
Unlike the government bond market, they can be bullied.
Insistence on 100% transmission in a scenario where deposit interest rates are fixed while lending rates are floating is to miss the wood for the trees.
Any reduction in the repo rate can only impact interest rates on fresh loans.
