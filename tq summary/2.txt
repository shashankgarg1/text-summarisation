As appears from my reasons for judgment published on 20 December 2004, the proceedings were complex in nature, due to the extent of the extraordinary issues raised by the applicants in the context of their endeavours to transfer, from the Local Court of NSW to the Federal Court of Australia, proceedings brought in the Local Court by the respondent against the applicants for a relatively minor liquidated claim.

Initially, the applicants had been represented in this Court by their relative, Ms Paras, a qualified solicitor, but following upon objections raised by the respondent to her retainer by the applicants, being objections supported by a ruling made by the Law Society of NSW on 17 June 2004, her representation of the applicants ceased in the proceedings.

3 On 11 January 2005, following upon his representation of the applicants at the hearing, Mr Law filed notice of ceasing to act as their legal representative, and no lawyer has since filed notice of any appointment to act in his place for the applicants.

4 On 9 June 2005, the solicitors for the successful respondent lodged in this Court, with a view to taxation, a detailed bill of costs totalling $15,958.85 for their professional fees and disbursements, and in addition for counsels' fees, totalling $8,525.00 payable to Mr Russell of counsel, and $220 payable to Mr Richardson of counsel, each of whom the solicitors had retained on behalf of the respondent.

6 Returning to the applicants' (that is of course Mr and Mrs Ualesi) objections filed on 26 July 2005 to the respondent's abovementioned detailed bill of costs, the respondent provided a comprehensive response thereto on 31 August 2005 called 'Respondent's Notice of Concessions and Specific Replies to Applicant's Notice of Objections dated 26 July 2005', which addressed the objections of the applicants in detail and conceded $499 by way of professional costs.

7 Nothing further thereafter transpired, by way of tender of any sum at all by the applicants to the respondent or otherwise, until the respondent moved the Court by notice of motion filed on 21 October 2005 for the following order (together with an order for the costs of that motion): The Respondent's position, as better detailed in the Notice of Concessions and Specific Replied (sic) to Applicant's Notice of Objections, is that the Applicants' Notice of Objections is replete with unfounded allegations, incorrect references to legislation and references to irrelevant authorities in lower jurisdictions.

Furthermore, I note that on 21 October 2005 the Respondent filed with the Court a notice of motion seeking to have the Court fix a gross sum in relation to indemnity costs and that the motion is returnable before Conti J on 22 November 2005.

11 The hearing of the respondent's application by notice of motion for an order that the Court fix a gross sum in relation to its indemnity costs, concerning the proceedings the subject of my reasons for judgment of 20 December 2004, came on for hearing on 22 November 2005.

A solicitor in the employ of the respondent's retained firm of solicitors Barringer Leather Lawyers, (being Mr Andjelkovic) testified as to the sending of his firm's abovementioned correspondence of 27 October 2005 addressed to 'Anastasia Ualesi, First Floor, 1 Melville Street, Ashbury, NSW 2193' and as to enclosing a copy of the notice of motion and the affidavit of Gregory Leather sworn 14 September 2005 by 'guaranteed next day delivery through Australia Post', and further as to the absence of any notice or other indication subsequently having been received from the applicants to the effect '...

13 In the light of the material to which I have drawn attention, I should draw the inference at the request of the respondent be taken the applicants received adequate and timely notice of the present application for the assessment of a fixed sum or sums for the costs and disbursements of the respondent related to the proceedings of 17 December 2004.

14 My attention was drawn by counsel for the respondent to Order 62 Rule 4(2)(c), and to the observations of von Doussa J in Beach Petroleum NL v Johnson (1995) 57 FCR 119 concerning the evident purpose of the Court's power to make costs orders of the kind here presently sought by the respondent, that being to avoid an ongoing counter productive dispute, in the interests of achieving finality, subject always to the need to ensure that unreasonable amounts of costs are not pursued and awarded.

Adopting a broad approach generally in line with that taken by von Doussa J in Beach Petroleum , albeit that the size of the proceedings there involved was incomparable to that litigated before me, yet nevertheless taking into account the degree of complexity of the proceedings occasioned by the purported issues raised by the applicants, I would assess the costs and disbursements of the respondent broadly in the sum of $20,400 inclusive of counsel's fees, that sum being of course not far short of the total amount claimed, but nevertheless taking into account the respondent's concession.

In reaching that figure, I have also considered the submissions of the applicants contained in their notice of objections to the respondent's bill of costs, those being the only submissions before me from the applicants on the costs sought.

16 That leaves unresolved the costs of the present interlocutory proceedings commenced by the respondent by notice of motion filed on 21 October 2005, in relation to which, as I have already recorded, there was no appearance by the applicants.

The conduct of the applicants since the conclusion of the hearing, which I have briefly outlined, renders it inevitable that a further adverse order as to the costs of the present application must be made in principle in favour of the respondent, as is sought in its notice of motion filed on 21 October 2005.
