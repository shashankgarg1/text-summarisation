Party president Amit Shah said Nitin Gadkari's wife had told his wife that Shah should learn from Gadkari's example and shed weight.

When former minister Kumari Selja was asked by the CPWD to vacate her ministerial bungalow at Motilal Nehru Road, she provided a list of alternative vacant government bungalows which she could be allotted as a senior MP.

This, in fact, is an MP bungalow coveted by many parliamentarians since Amar Singh spent a fortune on extensive renovations, including changing the flooring, installing large glass windows and building a terrace garden.

Although Amar Singh vacated the house a while ago, Kishore continues to reside at Vithal Bhai Patel House.

The buzz among MPs is that Amar Singh actually hopes to get a fresh Rajya Sabha term and return to the bungalow in which he has invested so much money.

Although there have been hints for months suggesting that Amar Singh is about to rejoin the Samajwadi Party, his return continues to be opposed by Akhilesh Yadav, Azam Khan, Jaya Bachchan and Ram Gopal Yadav.

Amar Singh has managed to bring Mulayam Singh Yadav around with the help of Mulayam's wife Sadhana and brother Shivpal.

There was an informal directive at the BJP parliamentary party meeting that MPs should avoid saying anything confrontational in the House that could aggravate the hostility between the BJP and Congress.
