Last year, total expenditure at the state level (17.1 per cent of the GDP) was much higher than the Centre's expenditure (13.3 per cent), and state capital expenditure (capex) was almost double the Centre's.

On the other, several states will likely have to absorb substantial chunks of state electricity board (SEB) debt explicitly on to their books.

This could either reflect a credit spread showing higher credit risk because there's no explicit sovereign guarantee for these bonds or a liquidity premium, given that the market for state bonds is much less liquid than that for G-Secs.

But the size of the CSF is 0.4 per cent of the GDP, versus an outstanding stock of state bonds of 9.5 per cent of the GDP.

Second, there's no real market for state bonds, with virtually no secondary market trading.

The current pool of investors largely comprises of public-sector banks, and state insurance and pension companies (the latter are mandated to hold state bonds), which can be thought of as captive buyers and ones, given their vantage point, that are likely less sensitive to credit risk across states.

And market signals are important because the 14th Finance Commission doesn't provide incentives for states to reduce deficits below 3 per cent of the GDP.

For example, it's only when state borrowing costs rise upon taking on SEB debt that states will be incentivised to reform them.

Now, we must extend that to the market for state debt, because in a couple of years, state deficits will account for almost half of the consolidated deficit.

We must now reform the market for state bonds by rolling back distortionary implicit sovereign guarantees.
