Some truly harsh words were uttered; memorably, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu defined politics as a "mission", not a "commission", and CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury said that the ruling party was seeking to "worm its way" into the freedom struggle and the Constitution through the debate.

We ought also to remember with him that people, "including our own, are being moved by new ideologies" and are "prepared to have governments for the people and are indifferent whether it is government of the people and by the people".

Article 17, an aspect of the fundamental right to equality, liberty and fraternity forbids "untouchability" and declares any practice on the ground of untouchability an offence, and Articles 23 and 24 forbid and declare as offences practices of trafficking in persons, agrestic serfdom and child labour.

Ours probably is the only constitution that declares as an aspect of fundamental rights certain social practices as an offence, which are to be redressed by parliamentary legislation and oversight under Article 35.

Progress seems to have been made, if we take on board the National Sample Survey Organisation's 2004-05 data, which estimates the number of working children at 90.75 lakh, and Census 2011, which places the number of working children in the age group of 5-14 years at 43.53 lakh.

Significantly, though these aspects were almost missing in the debate, no Constitution Day celebrations can be complete without a detailed recall of the communities of rights-less peoples.

These call for greater attention, alongside the varied groups of new rights-less people now created by the forces of globalisation, of which the constantly revictimised people of the Bhopal catastrophe are, till today, the first grim reminders.

The traditionally impoverished groups also include communities of misfortune, such as people living with disabilities, people of different sexual orientation and conduct, people declared guilty and incarcerated long before trial and, unfortunately, this list This overall picture would be a little less depressing if Parliament were to demonstrate the collective political will to celebrate Ambedkar Jayanti by declaring war on these unconstitutional evils and developing a timeline for eliminating them.
