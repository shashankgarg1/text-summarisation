During the last few years, and especially since its migration to Goa, many film lovers have observed that Iffi has been increasingly pandering to the tastes and styles of Bollywood, under the delusion that an international film festival like Iffi requires Bollywood stars to add charm to it.

This is in tune with trends in the international film festival circuit now run by individual programmers, curators, foundations and global production and marketing agencies.

Earlier, the films that made their way into the international festival circuit were selected or nominated by some state agency or similar cultural departments.

Since the 1990s, with the retreat of the state from cultural patronage, private agencies, museums, programmers and curators, apart from production houses and marketing agencies, have captured the international film festival circuit.

In this unequal cultural exchange, festivals like Iffi don't have much of a say but are forced to pay the prescribed screening fees to procure films in the circuit.

In both ways, we are on the losing side: We get their films to our festivals paying fat fees, whereas our films get a pittance.
