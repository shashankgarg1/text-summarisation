More specifically, the increase is 16 per cent in pay, 63 per cent in allowances and 24 per cent in pensions.

Two, the increase in the estimated share of the PAP in total revenue expenditure should be 3.81 per cent, as against 4.25 per cent suggested in the commission's report.

For instance, as compared to a hike of 54 per cent in the minimum pay in the Sixth Pay Commission, the hike this time is just about 14.3 per cent.

At the same time, it sticks to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) target of 2.4 per cent (for revenue deficit) and 3.5 per cent (for fiscal deficit), which, in turn, intrinsically assumes there would be no change (especially no reduction) in the growth of capital expenditure in 2016-17 compared to 2015-16.

The commission's recommendations will raise the revenue deficit by 0.63 per cent of GDP, with no change assumed in the capital expenditure and yet, it hopes to achieve the fiscal deficit target of 3.5 per cent in FY17.

And considering that the consensus GDP growth forecast for the current financial year is just 7.2 per cent, the commission's expectation of a 7.5 per cent GDP growth in the next financial year (FY17) looks unrealistic.

Further, an National Institute of Public Finance and Policy analysis (Working Paper No 2015-148) submitted to the 14th Finance Commission suggested that even with an assumption of a modest pay hike of 15 per cent (very close to the actual recommendations without One rank one pension), there is a need to compromise on either the fiscal deficit target or the share of capital expenditure (or perhaps both).

Another important issue that needs clarity is the commission's claim of a smaller increase in the PAP/ GDP ratio (at 0.63 per cent) as compared to the previous commission (at 0.77 per cent).
