As a member of Sandarbh, an artists' initiative hosting an international artists' residency supported by the Jaipur Art Summit 2015, I was in Jaipur on the morning of November 21.

At 10 am, a slightly concerned Siddhartha Kararwal called fellow artist and founding member of Sandarbh, Chintan Upadhyay.

He said that two constables from the neighbouring Bajaj Nagar thana had asked him to dismantle his work, produced during the residency and on exhibit at Shilpgram, Jawahar Kala Kendra, as part of the Jaipur Art Summit.

Kararwal's work, Bovine Divine, consisted of a styrofoam cow tied to an air balloon with a string, elevated to a height of about 50 metre.

Upadhyay and I reached the exhibition venue and saw that the work had been uninstalled, and a harassed-looking Kararwal was attempting to explain to the cops that his work was not humiliating the cow.

When the police insisted on removing the artwork, citing "hurt sentiments" of ordinary people, we sought to know how a sculpture that aims to create awareness about stray cows scavenging on the streets, eating plastic and choking to death could hurt someone's sentiments.

And the first reason cited by the officer concerned was that it was alright for Kararwal's work to be removed because it was not an artwork in the first place! Things took an even more bizarre turn as the conversation shifted from the "sentiments" of a faceless majority to the possible ways in which the work could be changed to appear more palatable to the police.

If CBFC members can play all-powerful film critics, then why can't a police constable decide what kind of work artists should make and people see? (All good horror plots have their dull moments.) Meanwhile, the police realised that neither Upadhyay nor I were the makers of the controversial art work.

So now, before releasing us, they thought it important to take custody of both the "culprit" artist and the cow.
