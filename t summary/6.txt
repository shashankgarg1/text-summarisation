He added that university authorities in UK were working closely with the British Council, and with students to develop a campaign to reach out to prospective students across the world and above all in India.

I have been saying for many years that the government should set targets to increase the number of international students entering the UK and, finally, the chancellor has listened and set a target of a 55,000 increase in the number of international students by 2019-2020.

Bilimoria said that after a prolonged period of sending out harmful, negative rhetoric to those hoping to study in the country, this proposal by Osborne puts the UK on the right course to make changes in policy that will not just allow but encourage international students to study in the country.

"I hope that the UK government will target prospective Indian students with its policy initiatives, for example by reintroducing a post-study work visa for foreign students, including Indian students, which were in place before the previous government changed it.

UK's Post Study Work Visa, which gave non-EU students the right to remain in the UK for two years after graduation, was closed in 2012.
