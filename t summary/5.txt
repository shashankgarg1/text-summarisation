In the one area where the governor should have shown some flexibility determination of the base rate using marginal cost of funding to get lending rates down the governor seems to have dug his heels in.

The RBI influences the yield curve through the repo rate and open market operations (OMO).

The impact of a change in the repo rate on banks' lending rates is, at best, minimal.

If the RBI wants to influence longerterm rates, it must combine repo rate action with aggressive OMO across maturities.

Insistence on 100% transmission in a scenario where deposit interest rates are fixed while lending rates are floating is to miss the wood for the trees.

Any reduction in the repo rate can only impact interest rates on fresh loans.

It cannot impact interest rates on old loans extended out of deposits contracted earlier at higher rates.

Over a period of time, as the quantum of incremental deposits taken at lower rates of interest increases, it will bring down the overall cost of funds for banks and lead to lower lending rates.

If the RBI does not see the logic of the argument, banks will ultimately be compelled to cut interest rates on deposits.

At a time when household savings in financial assets have contracted sharply and deposit growth has slowed, will the RBI's obduracy in using marginal cost of funding to fix base rates result in a remedy that is worse than the disease?
