1 This is an application in the original jurisdiction of the Court by way of an appeal under section 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ("the AAT Act ") from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal") by which the Tribunal determined that particular documents of the Applicant were not exempt on the contended ground of legal professional privilege, from access to the Respondent pursuant to Part III of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) ("the FOI Act ").

On 8 May 2003, Comcare made a decision to release certain documents and withhold "legal advice, internal working documents in relation to legal advice and investigation documents" on the ground that those documents were exempt from disclosure by operation of section 42(1) of the FOI Act because the documents are of such a nature that they would be privileged from production in legal proceedings on the ground of legal professional privilege.

However, those documents were documents within the category of group of documents Comcare decided were exempt under section 42(1) of the FOI Act and therefore "no purpose would be served in further identifying these documents" .

15 Accordingly, Comcare by reason of the purpose actuating the mind of Comcare's officer, Ms King, claims all the documents listed in Annexure "KAK1" (apart from expressly deleted references --- all further reference to the documents listed in Annexure "KAK1" exclude those documents in the Schedule shown with a line drawn through the particular entry) attract an exemption under the FOI Act (being the primary source of Ms Foster's application) on the ground that those documents (and the video recordings) would be privileged from production in legal proceedings (including proceedings in the performance of the Executive's administrative decision-making upon review in the Tribunal).

To the extent that any document within Annexure "KAK1" of Exhibit 1 withheld in reliance upon section 42(1) of the FOI Act also comprehended documents falling within section 59 of the SRC Act (and not disclosed), Comcare relied upon the privilege from production on the ground of legal professional privilege.

(b) apart from any document properly attracting legal professional privilege for the purposes of section 42 of the FOI Act , a number of documents identified within Annexure "KAK1" to Exhibit 1 could not be characterised as "internal working documents" for the purposes of section 36(1) of the FOI Act and that release of those documents would neither reveal the deliberative processes of Comcare nor be contrary to the public interest; There the Court overruled Grant v Downs , holding that the test for whether legal professional privilege exists is whether the dominant purpose for which the document came into existence was the purpose of obtaining legal advice and communication of legal advice or information which may be used in existing or possible legal proceedings.

Whether any (and, if so, which) of the circumstances set out in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) below render legal professional privilege inapplicable to a document or any (and, if so, which) part of that document, when the document is created for the dominant purpose of aiding a party in actual or anticipated legal proceedings in a court or administrative tribunal? Whether the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, in considering whether legal professional privilege applied to each of the documents referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) below, applied a correct legal test for determining whether legal professional privilege applied to that document? On all of the evidence available to the Tribunal in relation to each of the documents listed in paragraph 25 of the Tribunal's reasons for decision, it was not reasonably open to the Tribunal to conclude that legal professional privilege did not apply to that document.

22 Comcare contends that all the documents identified in Annexure "KAK1" to Exhibit 1 (including those documents found not exempt for the purposes of section 36 of the FOI Act ) attract the privilege from disclosure on the ground of legal professional privilege and the Tribunal in determining the necessary question of fact concerning the purpose for bringing the challenged material into existence, applied an incorrect test.

The Tribunal member examined each of the documents identified in Annexure "KAK1" and made a finding of fact that the documents described at paragraph 25 of the Reasons were not prepared for the dominant purpose of Comcare acquiring and Comcare's external independent lawyers, Phillips Fox, providing legal advice nor for the dominant purpose of Comcare being provided with legal services in relation to the proceedings before the Tribunal.

A proper reading of the Reasons of the Tribunal and particularly paragraph 26 of the Reasons suggest that the Tribunal member reached the finding that the documents described at paragraph 25 were not prepared for the dominant purpose of Comcare acquiring and Phillips Fox providing legal advice nor the provision and acquisition of legal services in connection with the proceedings for the reason that "most of the documents are purely procedural and only refer to information on the public record " .

Although views might differ ( Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Limited & Ors (1996 --- 1997) [1997] HCA 3 ; 188 CLR 501 ( "Propend Finance" ) per Gummow J at page 564) as to whether the privilege is to be characterised as a practical guarantee of fundamental, constitutional or human rights ( Attorney-General (NT) v Maurice [1986] HCA 80 ; (1986) 161 CLR 475 at 490), a substantive rule of law ( Carter v Northmore Hale Davy & Leake [1995] HCA 33 ; (1995) 183 CLR 121 at 161) or a traditional common law right which is not to be abolished or cut down otherwise than by clear statutory provision ( Bropho v Western Australia [1990] HCA 24 ; (1990) 171 CLR 1 at 17-18), it is now clear that legal professional privilege is a rule of substantive law available to a person to resist the giving of information or the production of documents which would reveal communications between a client and his or her lawyer made for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice or the provision of legal services, including representation in legal proceedings: The Daniels Corporation International Pty Ltd & Anor v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2002] HCA 49 ; (2002) 213 CLR 543 (" Daniels Corporation" ) at page 552 [9] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ.

36 In the joint judgment of Stephen, Mason and Murphy JJ in Grant v Downs [1976] HCA 63 ; (1976) 135 CLR 674 at 687-688, the adoption of a sole purpose test was in part influenced by a concern that where a multiplicity of purposes existed for the preparation of documents, many routine documents passing between management officers within an agency or corporation would also be provided to internal lawyers for a purpose of obtaining legal advice and that many such routine documents would become privileged "merely because one of their intended destinations was the desk of a lawyer" : Esso Australia at page 67 [43] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ.

38 In the present case, the evidence before the Tribunal was that the documents identified at paragraph 25 of the Reasons of the Tribunal were created for the dominant purpose of Comcare's independent lawyers giving and Comcare obtaining legal advice in respect of the claims by Ms Foster for compensation or her applications to the AAT for review of those claims.

The evidence was that Comcare had retained independent legal advisers, the point of intersection between Comcare and the independent advisers was Ms King or other officers within the "Appeals and Review Team", that Ms King had administrative responsibility for managing the claims by Ms Foster and Comcare's response to those claims, that Comcare was seeking advice, independent of Comcare, on Ms Foster's claims and Tribunal proceedings and that advice from the independent lawyers is kept physically separate from other material such as administrative material passing between internal officers within Comcare.

39 The question to be determined is not whether the material is routine and thus the evidence of dominant purpose to be rejected but whether, although routine, the material was brought into existence as part of, or evidence of, or components of, confidential communications between Comcare and its lawyers for the dominant purpose of Phillips Fox giving and Comcare obtaining legal advice or the provision and acquisition of legal services including representation in the proceedings.

The Tribunal concluded that the surveillance videos identified as Document E124 in Annexure "KAK1" to Exhibit 1 relate to a claim by Ms Foster for compensation and to the extent that the surveillance videos contain personal information about Ms Foster, the videos do not constitute an exempt document under section 42 and therefore are not properly the subject of a claim for legal professional privilege (apart from any question of whether an exemption might arise under sections 36 or 37 of the FOI Act ).

(b) for the reasons identified at [22] to [39], the Tribunal applied considerations (in determining whether the documents identified in paragraph 25 of the Reasons and paragraphs 38 and 39 of the Reasons attracted legal professional privilege), inconsistent with the correct legal test of whether the documents, although reflecting routine or purely procedural matter or information on the public record, are components of a confidential communication between Comcare and its independent lawyers for the dominant purpose asserted in the affidavit of Ms King reflected at [14] and [25];
