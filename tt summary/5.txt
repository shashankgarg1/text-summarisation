1 This is an appeal, pursuant to s 44 of the Administration Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ('the AAT Act'), from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal constituted by Mr P J Lindsay, Senior Member ('the Tribunal'), given on 18 January 2005.

'The tribunal affirms the decision under review in relation to the inclusion of the sum of $1,228,500 in the applicant's assessable income for the year ended 30 June 1988, but in relation to penalty remits the matter to the respondent with the direction that the assessment for that income year be amended by remitting additional tax in full. ' 3 The Commissioner of Taxation ('the Commissioner') appeals from so much of the Tribunal's decision as remits the matter of additional tax to the Commissioner with the direction that such additional tax be remitted in full.

The Tribunal erred in law in failing to hold that the Applicant's decision on objection refusing to remit additional tax imposed pursuant to sec 223 was an "ineligible income tax remission decision" under section 14ZS of the [Administration Act] and therefore not a "reviewable objection decision" for the purposes of section 14ZQ of that Act.

4.3 The Tribunal should have held that the Applicant's decision refusing to remit the additional tax was not a "reviewable objection decision" within the meaning of section 14ZQ of the [Administration Act] .

4.4 In so far as the Tribunal purported to direct the Applicant to remit additional tax payable under either section 207 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 or Division 1 of Part IIA of the [Administration Act] , the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to make such a direction.

4.5 If, contrary to the grounds set out in paragraphs 4.1 to 4.4 above, the Tribunal did have jurisdiction to direct that additional tax be remitted in full, the Tribunal, in purporting to make such a direction, erred in law in taking into account an irrelevant consideration namely the Applicant's consent to the matter remaining in abeyance before the Tribunal pending finalisation of other proceedings. ' (i) Neither counsel for the taxpayer, nor counsel for the Commissioner, nor the Tribunal was aware that the taxpayer had not included any ground in his notice of objection going to the additional tax imposed at label D of the amended notice of assessment.

(ii) If counsel for the taxpayer was aware that the taxpayer had not included any ground in his notice of objection going to the additional tax imposed at label D of the amended notice of assessment, no attempt was made, by way of application to the Tribunal, to include the additional tax issue as an additional ground of objection and, even if an application was made, no such order was made by the Tribunal pursuant to s 14ZZK of the Administration Act.

(iii) The Tribunal seems to have regarded itself as having jurisdiction with respect to not only additional tax imposed at label D of the amended notice of assessment, but also additional tax by way of interest for late payment of tax assessed pursuant to s 207 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ('the ITAA 36').

11 While the Tribunal's ultimate decision ([2], supra) in relation to 'penalty' is clearly a reference to additional tax imposed at label D of the amended notice of assessment, it is equally clear, in my view, that what the Tribunal is referring to in the last two sentences of par 61 of its reasons for decision and in the extract from the transcript cited above is the additional tax by way of interest pursuant to s 207 of the ITAA 36 and, if it is, it is clearly beyond the Tribunal's jurisdiction.

(2) An objection decision is an ineligible income tax remission decision if it relates to the remission of additional tax payable by a taxpayer under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 other than Division 11 of Part IIIAA , except where the additional tax is payable under Part VII of that Act and its amount, after the decision is made, exceeds: (i) if the statement relates to only one year of income --- the amount calculated, in respect of the period commencing on the day that is the prescribed day in relation to the taxpayer in relation to the year of income and ending on the day on which the assessment of the additional tax is made, at the rate of 20% per year of the amount of the relevant affected tax in relation to the taxpayer in relation to the year of income; or 15 It is difficult to understand the focus of the Commissioner on s 14ZS of the Administration Act in the present case when neither the taxpayer's objection nor, in consequence, the Commissioner's objection decision, referred in any way to the remission of additional tax imposed by the amended notice of assessment.

If an objection had been made to the assessment of penalty and an objection decision had been made in relation to that matter, there may have been (subject to the operation of s 14ZS of the Administration Act) some basis for saying that the exercise of a power to remit by the Tribunal was in the words of Hill J in Secretary, Department of Social Security v Hodgson (1992) 37 FCR 32 'relevant to the making of the decision under review'.

20 While the taxpayer did not include in his objection a ground putting in issue the imposition of additional tax; and while the Commissioner's objection decision disallowing the taxpayer's objection did not, in consequence, deal with that issue; and while the taxpayer had no right to agitate the issue before the Tribunal unless the Tribunal otherwise ordered (s 14ZZK(a) of the Administration Act), which the Tribunal did not, nevertheless, in deciding the taxpayer's objection, the Commissioner could have further remitted the additional tax imposed at label D of the notice of amended assessment, pursuant to the discretion vested in him by subs 227(3) of the ITAA 36.

The fact that he had already exercised this discretion, at the time of assessment to remit the additional tax to $586,858.75 was no bar or impediment to his further remission of the additional tax at the time of making his objection decision.

21 If this be right, then it is difficult to see why subs 43(1) of the AAT Act did not give the Tribunal jurisdiction to make that part of the decision against which this appeal is brought, namely, remission of the penalty matter to the Commissioner with the direction that the assessment for the year ended 30 June 1988 be amended by remitting additional tax in full.

It is neither necessary nor permissible to put a gloss upon s 43 that would permit the Tribunal to exercise the discretion maker's powers and discretions only when those powers or discretions are necessarily interdependent with the decision under review, or where the power or discretion to be exercised by the Tribunal is necessarily involved in the making of the decision under review --- see Secretary, Department of Social Security v Hodgson [supra].

23 There can be no doubt, in the present case, that the exercise by the Tribunal of the discretion to remit the matter of the additional tax to the Commissioner with a direction that the additional tax be remitted in full is relevant to the making of the objection decision, if not dependent upon it.
